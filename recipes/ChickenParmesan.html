    <h3>Discription:</h3><br>
    I love chicken parm, especially when it's made with fresh mozzarella, which it almost never is in restaurants. <br>
    Of course, at home we can use the real stuff, but it can be pricey. <br>
    So I tried something new--a cheese spread using ricotta fortified with sharp Cheddar.<br>

    <!-- List of ingridients -->
    <br><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch of ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ flour</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>¾ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>½ cup light olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <br><strong>Cheese Spread:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>½ ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded sharp white cheddar</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese for topping</li>
    </ul>
    <br><strong>Steps:</strong>
    <ol>
        <br><li>Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.
            </li>

        <br><li>Gently pound chicken breasts between 2 layers of plastic until each breast is evenly thick. 
                Place breasts on a plate and season 1 side with kosher salt and black pepper. <br>
                Sprinkle with flour; press flour to coat the entire surface and help it adhere. <br>
                Turn and repeat on second side with salt, pepper, and flour.
            </li>

        <br><li>Brush excess flour from plate; place the chicken breasts back on the plate. <br>
                Pour beaten egg over the breasts and coat each side. Cover bottom of a second plate with half the bread crumbs. <br>
                Transfer chicken to the bread crumbs. Push crumbs up sides of chicken. Sprinkle on the remaining crumbs and thoroughly coat each side. 
            </li>

        <br><li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken until crispy and golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to prepared baking sheet.
            </li>

        <br><li>Mix ricotta and Cheddar cheese together in a bowl. Stir in salt, black pepper, cayenne, and olive oil. <br>
                Spread half the cheese mixture on each breast without extending all the way to the edges. <br>
                Dust with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and drizzle with olive oil. 
            </li>

        <br><li>Bake on center rack of preheated oven until cheese is melted and chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 10 to 12 minutes. <br>
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). 
            </li>

        <br><li>To serve, ladle the heated marinara sauce in a wide circle on warm plates. Place chicken in center and sprinkle with chopped parsley. 
            </li>

    </ol>
